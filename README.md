## Hello gays /silly

You can call me <ins>Mint</ins> <sup>he/it</sup>.
  - I don't have any actual knowledge of programming, outside of a bit of Python from back in high school, but I'm ready to learn.
  - I'm most likely to work on very, very silly stuff. I don't take myself too seriously.
  - I happen, as you may not know, to be actively running under a GNU/Linux operating system most commonly known as "Arch"... btw. /silly

I wouldn't be surprised if this either become another dead account of mine, or if I somehow end up making gay robots.
